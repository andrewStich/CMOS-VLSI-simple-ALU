# CMOS-VLSI-simple-ALU
CMOS/VLSI design final project. We were asked to design and test a number of CMOS logic gates in order to create an 4-bit ALU that adds, subtracts, and multiplies.

The end-goal of this project was to create an a 4-bit ALU that multiplied, added, and subtracted. It had two 4-bit inputs and a 2-bit select line that would select between the three operations.

## Addition/Subtraction operation

Project one was assigned individually while project 2 was assigned to us in groups of 2. I found this project to be especially interesting and fun once I learend how to use the cadence software, so I did most of it in my free time. This led to me doing all the schemetics, testbenches, and layouts and finishing it 3 weeks before it was due. My partner then wrote up the report.
